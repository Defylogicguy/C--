# C-- 🧠💻

Welcome to **C--**, a personal archive where I store all the programming problems I've solved — and sometimes half-solved (because, hey, we all get lazy 😴). This repo includes my coding journey starting from **Grade 8**, covering problems from various **competitive programming platforms**.

## 📂 What's Inside

This repository contains code solutions (and some WIPs) from a variety of **Online Judges (OJs)**, including:

- **[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)** (I don't upload anymore)
- **[CSP by VNOI](https://csp.vnoi.info/)**
- **[HNOJ (Hanoi Online Judge)](https://hnoj.edu.vn/)**
- **[Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/)**
- **[Kids Who Code (C2406)](https://kidswhocode.tech/)**
- **[Virtual Judge (HSGS)](https://vjudge.net)**

The code ranges from polished and optimized to experimental and exploratory.

## 🔥 Mission Statement 🔥

I’m on a mission to:

- 📈 Reach **Candidate Master** on Codeforces  
- ⭐ Achieve **5★** on CodeChef  
- 🧠 Keep improving by solving diverse problems across multiple OJs

This repository helps me track progress, stay motivated, and reflect on my growth as a competitive programmer.

## 📌 Notes

- Code may vary in quality — from clean and well-commented to rough and incomplete (I leave everything in for reference).
- Folder structure is generally based on platforms or contests.
- Some solutions may include custom test cases, templates, or debugging notes.
- If you're looking through this, don’t expect perfect code — this is raw, real progress. 😄
